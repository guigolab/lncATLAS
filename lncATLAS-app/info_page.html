      LncATLAS is an easy to use web-based visualization tool to obtain useful
      information about expression localization of long non-coding class of
      RNAs. It is easy to use by just searching your lncRNA of interest in the
      search box. You can also use ENSEMBL gene IDs to select
      them. There are also some reference genes with a clear nuclear or
      cytoplasmatic expression profile. In some plots (3 and 4) you
      could also select the cell line from the dropdown menu to obtain a zoom
      into the distributions.
      Although many genes would have a similar
      profile among cell lines there might exist small changes.

      In lncATLAS we provide 6 charts that can be divided into 3 sections:
      <ol>
        <li>Inspect the cytoplasmic-nuclear localisation of your gene of interest
           (GOI): a barplot indicating the CN RCI values in each cell line for
           the selected gene(s)</li>
        <li>Inspect the cytoplasmic-nuclear localisation of your GOI within the
           distribution of all genes: distribution of RCI values in each cell
           line for lncRNAs and mRNAs with the selected gene(s) highlighted</li>
        <li>Inspect the localisation of your GOI at sub-compartment level:
          localisation values within distributions for the K562 cell line
           subnuclear and subcytoplasmic compartments</li>
      </ol>

      The 2 major alternative usages for lncATLAS are to download raw data for
      a single selection of genes that can be done directly on the front page or
      to download a specific data set from a list of gene IDs in a batch mode.
      This second
      feature is in the get raw data tab.

     After entering the list a <code> .csv </code> file with
     the expression values from the selected genes will be generated.

      In the input, gene IDs must be placed as a column.
     </p>
    <h4 class="text-center"> Multiple gene selection</h4>
    <p class="text-justify">
      In the main page, in the search box, you can enter at least
      3 genes by the gene name and for the gene ID input. If more, only the
      first 3 will be considered.    </p>

      The data used and displayed in lncATLAS is directly obtained from
      GENCODE release (
      <a href="http://www.gencodegenes.org/releases/24.html">V24 </a>
      ). and is available through our web site in the
      download all data button from get raw data panel.

      The RCI or Relative Concentration Index has been calculated as follows:
      $$ RCI = \log_{2} (\frac{Fraction_{i} \quad (RPKMs)}{Fraction_{j} \quad (RPKMs)}) $$
      <br>
      Being the fraction i the cytoplasm and j the nuclear one for CN
      RCI shown in most plots. This changes for appropiate subnuclear and
      subcytoplasmic fractions in the last plot from the K562 cell line.

      Our intention in representing the subcellular localisation with the RCI is
      to give a value that represents how more concentrated is a particular
      gene in one fraction compared to another. It's a flexible approach that
      permits to compare individual genes easily.

      All the subcellular compartiments available are shown in the
      following diagram.
